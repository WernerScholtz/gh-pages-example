This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I used this as an opportunity to get to know React as well as Github Pages. The currency converter API I used can be found at the link below:

The project was created using the Create-React-App bootstrapped app from the facebook incubator. Other than that I also used the following:
"react-select" for the dropdowns
"react-bootstrap" and "bootstrap" for making a grid system to position the items and to make it mobile friendly
